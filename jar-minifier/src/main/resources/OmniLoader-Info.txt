As you have probably noticed the structure of this mod is a little strange.
This is because this mod uses OmniLoader, OmniLoader is a library that allows mods
to selectively load different jars based on what Minecraft version is being loaded.
To further optimize jar size, this mod is split over multiple jars where some jars are used
on multiple Minecraft versions, while some are only used on one. To see what jars are loaded
when, please see the omniloader.json file.
